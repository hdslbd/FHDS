The grading scale for this course consists of the standard scale, including minus grades, below: 94 - 100 = A 90 – 93.9 = A- 87 – 89.9 = B+ 83 – 86.9 = B 80 – 82.9 = B = 77 – 79.9 = C+ 73 – 76.9 = C 70 – 72.9 = C- 67 – 69.9 = D+ 63 – 66.9 = D 60 – 62.9 = D- Below 60 = F
**NB: Participants who will carry F grade she/he will not be certified.**

## Lab Assignments
There were 20 lab assignments for the lab component, with 100 points for each. The average score was 50% of the final grade. Owing to the size of the class, the assignments should be handed in by the due date. Otherwise, 15 points will be AUTOMATICALLY deducted per day after the due date. Assignments received after the 7-day late period will not be graded, and AUTOMATICALLY will receive 0 points. This timing allows you to finish with one week’s material before starting the next unit’s material.

## Quizzes 
There are 5 quizzes that occur each with 100 points. The average score was 20% of the final grade. This will test you on lecture materials covered within the five most recent units. Quizzes can be completed only if the instructor receives a prior notification of absence.

## Final Project & Presentation 
Students were asked to select a specific topic based on their interests and complete a data analysis of individual projects using the methods covered in class, summarized in a formal report in R. The final project and presentation accounted for 25% of the final grade. Students were expected to give a maximum of seven minutes about their projects. After the final presentation, they were required to hand in the R-script project along with the dataset in a designated format. The final report is due by [Comming!]

## Attendance/Participation
The university’s policy is that all students should attend all classes. Of course, not all students will, or can, attend all classes due to intercollegiate athletic events, university-sanctioned co-curricular activities, course field trips, religious holidays, family emergencies, and personal illness. As a result, students are allowed to miss a maximum of 10% of the class meeting time without a grade penalty. The student is responsible for all course materials and graded work because of absence. It is at the discretion of the professor to decide if, when, where, and how the missed work is completed. If something unexpected occurs, please inform the instructor in advance. The absence of such notice prevents students from completing assignments.

## Required Materials 
Participants need to bring their headphones to listen to on the Zoom session during class time.

## Communication 
Emails (training.chiralbd@gmail.com) will be answered as quickly as possible (typically within 24 h) but may not generate an immediate response. If more than 48 hours passed without a response, please resend the message. Please let us know if you have problems that interfere with your progress during this course. We will do all we can help you. Please see us as soon as possible if you experience difficulty at any point in the course.

## Other Important Information
(The) non-discrimination policy of CHIRAL Bangladesh affirms a commitment to diversity in a variety of forms, believing that diversity is more than an all-inclusive list of demographics. The CHIRAL Bangladesh prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race or ethnicity, marital status, sex, age, gender expression or identity, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, disability, or veteran status. The discrimination or harassment of members of the CHIRAL Bangladesh falls short of our community standards and will not be tolerated.

## Academic Integrity 
Academic honesty is expected at all times. Academic dishonesty includes claiming someone else’s work as your own (e.g., plagiarism), seeking an unfair advantage over other students in taking a test or fulfilling an assignment, and fraud. Any offense will result in a zero or grade of **F** for the exam or assignment in question and may result in failure of the course. Infractions will be reported to the student’s advisor and to the Associate Academic Coordinator. 

## Policy on Make-Up Work
Participants are allowed to make up assignments **ONLY** as the result of illness or other unanticipated circumstances warranting a medical excuse and resulting in the student missing homework or exam, consistent with CHIRAL policy. Documentation from a health care provider is required. For any other non-medical reason, assignments missed will receive a penalty of 10 points per day after the due date, and the mid-exam missed will receive a zero point.
