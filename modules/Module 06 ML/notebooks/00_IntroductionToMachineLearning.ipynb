    "A machine learning system builds prediction models, learns from previous data, and predicts the output of new data whenever it receives it. The amount of data helps to build a better model that accurately predicts the output, which in turn affects the accuracy of the predicted output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a complex problem in which we need to make predictions. Instead of writing code, we just need to feed the data to generic algorithms, which build the logic based on the data and predict the output. Our perspective on the issue has changed as a result of machine learning. The Machine Learning algorithm's operation is depicted in the following block diagram:\n",
