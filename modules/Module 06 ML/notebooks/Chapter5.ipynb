    "Correlation refers to the relationship between two variables and how they may or may not change together. The most common method for calculating correlation is Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient, that assumes a normal distribution of the attributes involved. A correlation of -1 or 1 shows a full negative or positive correlation respectively. Whereas a value of 0 shows no correlation at all. Some machine learning algorithms like linear and logistic regression can suffer poor performance if there are highly correlated attributes in your dataset. As such, it is a good idea to review all of the pairwise correlations of the attributes in your dataset. You can use the `corr()` function on the Pandas DataFrame to calculate a correlation matrix."
